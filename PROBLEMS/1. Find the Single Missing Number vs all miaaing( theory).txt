1. Find the Single Missing Number
Problem: Given an array of size n-1 containing numbers from 1 to n (with one number missing), find the missing number.
Example:
java
Copy
Edit
Input:  [1, 2, 4, 5]
Output: 3  (because 3 is missing)
Solution: Use sum formula (n(n+1)/2) or XOR to find the missing number in O(n) time and O(1) space.
2. Find All Missing Numbers
Problem: Given an array of size n containing numbers from 1 to n (with some numbers missing and some repeated), find all missing numbers.
Example:
java
Copy
Edit
Input:  [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
Output: [5,6]  (because 5 and 6 are missing)
Solution: Use a HashSet or in-place marking to find all missing numbers in O(n) time.
