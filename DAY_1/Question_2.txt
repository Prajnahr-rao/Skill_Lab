Explanation:
HashMap for Frequency Counting: We use a HashMap to store the frequency of each rating. The key is the rating, and the value is the count of how many times it appears in the array.

Iterate Through the Array: We iterate through the array and update the frequency map.

Find the Most Frequent Rating: After populating the frequency map, we iterate through it to find the rating with the highest frequency.

Edge Cases: The code handles edge cases such as an empty array or multiple ratings with the same highest frequency.
